Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by web browsers
that controls how resources on a web server can be requested from another domain. 
It's a crucial mechanism for managing cross-origin requests and ensuring secure interactions
between different origins on the web.



so google.com should be able to send resources to api.google.com    CORS should work
but facebook.com should not be able to send resources to api.hdfcbank.com     CORS should not work
