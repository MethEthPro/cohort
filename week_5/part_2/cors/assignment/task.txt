1 . create a HTTP server that does something
2 . write a html file that hits this backend file using fetch api 

you should know how to serve a html file 
using   npx serve 

once you have both frontend and backend running
You will notice the cross origin request fails


first install the cors library using 
npm install cors
Use the cors middleware



but if you host frontend and backend on the same location
then there is no cross origin happening so there wont be any problem obviously
